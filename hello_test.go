var fakeEntry = " Hay Fever was a comical play with a strong message. The actors throughout this play steadily used others to gain their own attention. The message this play left behind after many laughs was do not use others, plain and simple.The space was a well-constructed thrust stage however, the stage was not raised off the ground and the seats appeared to be mobile which lead to the belief that this is an Environmental Theater. As for the layout of the stage, there was a couch and a table in center stage for the first two acts, a door to the unseen outside front of the house upstage right, there were two large double doors upstage center leading to the backyard garden, and a raised floor upstage left containing a piano, a bookcase and a door leading to the home library. Stage left there was a half spiral staircase that lead up to the second floor which had a painting and lights that extended across to stage right. The second floor also contained the bedrooms for the house but the doors were not in sight. The detail was greater than expected: the hardwood floor throughout the first floor seemed to be genuine, the actual bookcase filled with real books not stage books, and the extremely large double doors with translucent glass and floral designs lead to the Garden, which featured an array of plants behind the doors. The entire space was well lit for the duration of the play; the stage took place inside the Bliss home so the bright lighting added a confortable feel to the inside of the house. The theatre was nearly sold out; it was hard to spot an empty seat, including the balcony and lower level seating. The crowd contained nearly an even amount of student audience members and senior citizens; there was few in the audience that appeared middle aged.The play was well cast, the entire Bliss family did a great job showing how overly dramatic and deceitful the family had become. Each actor portrayed their character accurately; there were no standouts that did match the character. Each visitor in the first act seemed to be feasible as far as the possibility of a relationship was concerned. All of the family members acted genuine. There was one actor who stood out as a perfect fit for his character. Taylor Rascher played Simon Bliss and played him perfectly. Raschers character Simon was a young man who was dramatic and romantic so much so it was almost to the point of ridiculousness. Rascher stole the show in the first act when he was romancing with Michelle Luz, who plays Myra Arundel. Rascher was displaying his love for Michelle Luz (Myra) in the most dramatic of fashions; he was playing the Blis game of pretending to be in complete love with someone and then a moment later change his mind. Rascher was proclaiming his love with elegant speeches and coddling up next to her and eventually kissing her. Rascher made this scene particularly hilarious because he was completely over the top in typical Bliss fashion. Of course, all of this was for naught because Luz ended up kissing Joe Hubbar character David Bliss in act two and also Rascher proclaimed his engagement to Caitlin Stagemolles character, Jackie Coryton. Rascher made his voice more shrill and audible to appear to be more dramatic and create more attention for himself. In the same way, Rascher used grander gestures with his arms (flailing, waving, etc.) to cause a more dramatic effect. The play was well interpreted by all whom were involved. Steven Wrentmore, the Director, kept the 1920s feel by dressing in all 1920s costumes and everyone spoke as if they were living at the time. Michelle Bisbee, the scene designer, made the inside of the home appear 192 because everything was grand. The Bliss home was grand with the spiral staircase, the very large backdoors, and the eloquent piano. The actorsmannerisms seemed like they were portraying a silent film. In older movies, actors seemed very dramatic and had flamboyant actions to prove so; the actors in Hay Fever shared the same feel for the dramatics. As far as Stephen Wrentmore directing goes, he did an excellent job. The scene when Chris Karl (Richard) and Caitlin Stegemoller (Jackie) enter and are left alone to make small talk with each other is the best pertaining to directing. The two actors used the entire stage in this scene and were very awkward with one another. This was Wrentmor doing because you could tell he had a vision for this scene in particular because it seemed very crisp and well rehearsed. The actors played it perfect with the excessively long pauses in their awkward small talk that the crowd was laughing through the entire scene. It appeared that Wrentmore instructed the actors, to keep their pauses longer than natural to heighten the awkward tension in the scene, which made it brilliant.The blocking throughout the play worked with the floor plan very well. All of the blocking worked seamlessly; the actors were never out of sight or in awkward positioning (ex. turned around, talking to someone behind them while face forward, etc.) even during the second act in the first scene while all eight actors were on set. One part of the set that stood out was the staircase, it is obviously very large, but the way Owen Virgin followed Megan Davis up the stairs was seamless. They both walked up the stairs with footsteps I unison, and Owen Virgin was so focused on every detail of Davis, it almost screamed out how much he was infatuated with her. The overall mood that was portrayed by the combination of lighting, sound, set, and costumes was very light and cheerful; at no point did the mood drop to something darker or saddening. This is common with many comedies because it becomes hard to laugh if the overall mood is down and dreary. The theatre space was very personal. First of all, it takes place in someone home so it is immediately personal. Also, the stage was built into the crowd just about so the audience felt like they were living the action out as it unfolded. The scenic design showed the audience without a doubt it was the 192s, with the barometer on the wall, the staircase, the piano, and the lights upstairs. However, there was little evidence to show what location the play took place."

	expected3 := "\"dateSelected\":\"2023-03-28\",\"entry\":\"A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure that is used to store and search for words in a given set of text. This compares to a binary search tree of strings as a binary search tree completely balanced would require a time complexity of O(mlogn) (with m being number of characters in the string and n being the number of nodes in the tree). However for a trie the time complexity for search is O(m) Each node in the trie represents a single letter in the text, and the path from the root of the trie to a given node represents a word in the text. The structure for a true also includes a Boolean. This Boolean is used to check if the end of the word has been reached or not. The boolean is marked everytime the last node of a word is inserted so later it can check to know whether or not the end of the key has been reached when searching. \n\nThe trie has two basic operations: search and insert. In the search operation, the trie is traversed from the root node to find a given word in the text. If the word is found, the search operation returns the node that represents the last letter of the word. If the word is not found, the search operation returns null.  The search with either terminate due to the end of a string as based off the previously mentioned Boolean or from a lack of the key appearing in the trie. If the trie is terminated using the Boolean then the key is present in the tree. In the other case it terminates early, not examining every character in the key, since the key is not in the trie. As previously mentioned this is just O(m) as it only is checking every character in the words instead of every node then traversing the string in that node as might be done in a balanced binary search tree. \n\nThe insert operation adds a new word to the trie. However it‚Äôs important to know that the children in the tree are an array of pointers to the trie nodes in the following levels. The key character is justhe length of the key is tied to the depth of the true. This new path represents the new word that has been added to the trie. Anothests in the text. If the wr main operation of a trie is the remove function. The remove operation removes a word from the trie. To remove a word, the trie is f means that on non-existiso removes any nodes that are no longer connected to the trie as a result of removing the given word.\n\nTries are useful for searchitrue. This new path repreng and storing text because they allow for fast search operations.

This makes tries an efficient data structure for text search and storage the trie.
