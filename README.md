# ISEProject
Project name: Thought Dump   
Project description: "Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, ideally done first thing in the morning."  
They center you and clear your mind.  

They help you discover your creativity.

They help to silence your biggest enemy.  
Your inner critic.
They make you less anxious.  
Writing helps sweep away anxiety. 
They will help you become a better idea generator.
