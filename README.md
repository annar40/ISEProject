Project name: Thought Dump   


Project description:
Psychologists have found that humans benefit from filling three pages with their thoughts. This is typically done in the morning. The benefits of this include increased creativity, decreased anxiety, and clear thoughts.  This site will aim to create a space for people to write their three pages in the morning. They will be able to track their progress with a streak.
