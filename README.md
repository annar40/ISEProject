Project name: Thought Dump   
 
 
Project description:
Psychologists have found that humans benefit from filling three pages with their thoughts at the start of each day. The benefits of this practice include increased creativity, decreased anxiety, and overall a more clear mind. There is emphasis on the number of pages that must be filled because "you can't write about nothing for three full pages." In essence, one's subconscious thoughts will come through. 

"Thought Dump" will be a website that serves as a virtual medium for people to execute this practice. It will encourage users to type their thoughts until a word count is met. They will be able to login and track their consecutiveness with a daily streak.
